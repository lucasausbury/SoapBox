        <p>Hair up, glasses off. A flower in my garden, a mystery in my panties.</p>
        
        <p>So, what do you say? We got a basket full of father-son fun here. What's 
            Kama Sutra oil? Maybe it's not for us. If that man's straight, then I am sober.</p>
            
        <p>Do you guys know where I could get one of those gold necklaces with the T on it? 
            That's a cross. Across from where? I see you've wasted no time in filling my seat 
            hole. He's a regular Freddie Wilson, that one.</p>
            
        <p>In prison, you just have to close your eyes and take it, but here you have to close 
            your eyes and give it. Annhog's coming? Uncle Gob, was Aunt Lindsay ever pregnant? 
            Yeah, sure, dozens of times. Don't leave your Uncle T-bag hanging. I call it 
            Tricks –- wait for it – Around The Office. Dead Dove DO NOT EAT. If I look like a man 
            who made love to his wife last night – it's because I almost did.</p>
            
        <p>Michael, I'm your older brother. I'll never be proud of you. Whoa whoa whoa whoa. Wait. 
            Are you telling me you have a multi-stage trick with hidden identities?</p>

        <p>I don't appreciate the dry British humor. Are you aware of this? Coming soon. Indeed.</p>
        
        <p>So, what do you say? We got a basket full of father-son fun here. What's Kama Sutra oil? 
            Maybe it's not for us. George Michael, you want to put your head down there by his 
            drainage shunt? Do you have any idea how often you say the word "afraid"? Well, I know I 
            used it in the Jacuzzi. Do the right thing here. String this blind girl along so that 
            dad doesn't have to pay his debt to society. Excuse me, do these effectively hide my 
            thunder? Sorry, some of my students are arguing the significance of the shankbone on 
            the seder plate. But we do not - NOT wag our genitals at one another to make a point. 
            Ohhh little guy. The tears aren't coming. The tears just aren't coming.</p>
            
        <p>She calls it a Mayonegg. You stay on top of her, Buddy. Don't be afraid to ride her. Hard. 
            Touché, Pandora. One of the guys told me to take my head out of my BOTTOM and get back 
            to work…my BOTTOM! Hahahaha. Fun and failure both start out the same way. And although 
            the intervention didn't work, it turned into one of the Bluth family's better parties. 
            It's as Ann as the nose on Plain's face.</p>
            
        <p>YOU'RE the Chiclet! Not me. Caw ca caw, caw ca caw, caw ca caw! Daddy horny, Michael. YOU'RE 
            the Chiclet! Not me. Caw ca caw, caw ca caw, caw ca caw! Steve Holt? The moron jock? Do 
            the right thing here. String this blind girl along so that dad doesn't have to pay his 
            debt to society.</p>
            
        <p>I've been in the film business for a while but I just cant seem to get one in the can. 
            I know, I just call her Annabelle cause she's shaped like a…she's the belle of the ball! 
            I was hoping he would be gifted sexually. It's as Ann as the nose on Plain's face. The Man 
            Inside Me seems well reviewed.</p>

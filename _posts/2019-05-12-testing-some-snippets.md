This is a test of the context feature. If this works as expected, the homepage should pull in a context snippet of this article instead of just the heading. That would be ideal, as it is easy to programmatically build a header as part of the template with the title in it, but difficult to generate a context snippet. That is a tricky thing to do.

I believe it should pull the first paragraph, but I am wondering if it might be the first paragraph up to a certain number of characters. I should probably test that with a third post. If that isnâ€™t the case, it will be something to keep in mind as the first paragraph should always be designed in a way that it introduces the topic and can work as a snippet.

Alright, I think that is enough testing.

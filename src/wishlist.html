	<h1 class="title">My wishlist</h1>
	<h2 class="subtitle">Getting down to business</h2>

	<div class="content">
		<p>First and foremost, I'm building an inclusive list with a variety of voices and genres. I love 
			working with <mark>#OwnVoices</mark> authors, and I'm looking for voices from diverse and 
			underrepresented backgrounds, regardless of genre, even if it's "tropey," "overdone," or 
			"outdated." I want to see it all!</p>

		<p>In a nutshell, I am looking for fresh voices and fresh takes in the following categories:</p>

		<h3>Middle Grade</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Magical realism and contemporary fantasy</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Give me a story with a magical school where the MC is a POC. Something with humor and heart 
						and, duh, magic!</li>
					<li>Stories inspired by myths, folklore, or legends, particularly those that are non-western 
						in origin</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Humor</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>A novel that will make adults and kids alike laugh while they read (think Shrek-type humor 
						but a little more immature)</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Adventure</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>I would love to find a MG version of The Mummy (the Brendan Frasier version, of course)</li>
					<li>Characters that are on the spectrum, but their story is not centered on that; it's just 
						who they are. Because characters on the spectrum can fight dragons and save the world too!</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Animals</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>I’m a giant animal lover and a total sucker for beautiful emotional stories that involve 
						animals like Pax and The One and Only Ivan</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Young Adult Fiction</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Fantasy</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>My first love is character-driven fantasy (urban, contemporary, high—all of it!). &lt;3 A 
						new retelling of an old trope? A mythical setting inspired by a non-European culture? A 
						reluctant hero who inevitably shouts, “I never asked for any of this!”? Sign me up! I'm 
						looking for strong world-building, strange magic, empathetic villains, morally gray 
						heroes, and subversive fantasy tropes</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Contemporary horror/thrillers</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Creeptastic thrillers with a tightly-knit, well-paced plot, clever and nuanced characters, 
						and a twist that readers will never see coming. I generally steer clear of excessive 
						on-page violence.</li>
					<li>Dystopian and paranormal are some of my subgenres. Ghosts, vampires, and contagions are 
						very much welcome in my inbox</li>
					<li>A heist narrative like a YA Ocean’s Eleven</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Contemporary</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>High concept contemporary fiction aimed at all genders. Bonus points if it makes me 
						laugh and/or cry. Evergreen themes: self love, coming of age, girls supporting 
						girls, friendship and friendship breakups, and slow burn romances.</li>
					<li>Topical contemporary fiction addressing real issues that teens face</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Science Fiction</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Accessible science fiction. Think Star Wars or superhero movies. I'm looking 
						for a strong grounded story in which you do not need to understand the ins 
						and outs of time travel and quantum physics in order to follow along</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Young YA</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Fiction aimed at younger YA audiences to fill the space where MG ends and 
						traditional YA begins. Great writing is a must. Great character development 
						and an unforgettable voice really drive it home.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>New Adult/Adult</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Commercial, literary, and genre women’s fiction.</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>I’m particularly interested in the adventures of twenty-something women 
						navigating the start of professional life after college. Think a younger version 
						of Sex and the City</li>
					<li>I’d also love to find a psychological thriller like Caroline Kepnes' You with a 
						strong and complicated MC</li>
					<li>I’m also on the lookout for cozy mysteries with a strong female MC and humorous 
						writing style</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

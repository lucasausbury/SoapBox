        <p>Hannah VanVels is an editor, writer, and literary agent. Her life is 
            consumed by all things books, and when she’s not working on books, she 
            can usually be found curled up with a good book and a good cup of coffee.</p>
            
        <p>She earned her BA at the University of Michigan and holds MA degrees from 
            Tel Aviv University and the University of Chicago. Hannah has worked various 
            bookish jobs including a stint as a bookseller at Barnes & Noble, a freelance 
            editor for scholarly and academic essays and journals, and most recently as 
            the acquiring editor at a young adult imprint with HarperCollins Publishing.</p>
            
        <p>With nearly a decade of editorial work under her belt, Hannah made the jump to 
            freelance editing. Her editing business was born out of a love for working 
            closely with authors and coming alongside them to make their vision come to 
            life on page. On the fiction side, Hannah has worked on everything from epic 
            fantasies to fast-paced thrillers and mysteries, accessible science fiction to 
            immersive historical fiction, romantic comedies to heartfelt topical books. On 
            the nonfiction side, Hannah has worked on narrative memoirs, topical books, and 
            devotionals. Whether working on fiction or nonfiction, it’s always Hannah’s goal 
            to preserve the author’s vision and voice and take their writing to the next level.</p> 
            
        <p>Hannah lives in West Michigan with her partner, 
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BwIAoJJg5bU" target="_blank">two German Shepherds, and two cats.</a></p>

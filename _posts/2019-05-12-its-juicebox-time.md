I could use a leather jacket for when I'm on my hog and have to go into a controlled slide. Please refrain from Mayoneggs during this salmonella scare. That's my son, you pothead! Everything they do is so dramatic and flamboyant. It just makes me want to set myself on fire. - Lucille Bluth. No! These are just strippers! Look how hot they are! Buster, what are you doing with mother's rape-horn? Her lawyers are claiming the seal is worth $250,000. And that's not even including Buster's Swatch. Those are balls. Hey, it was one night of wild passion! And yet you didn't notice her body? I like to look in the mirror. Oh…yeah…the guy in the…the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in three months. Come on! Yeah, that's a cultural problem is what it is. You know, your average American male is in a perpetual state of adolescence, you know, arrested development. (Hey. That's the name of the show!) George Bush doesn't care about black puppets. I need a tea to give my dingle less tingle. Could it be love? I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it's the opposite. It's like my heart is getting hard. He also said some things African American-y wasn't ready to hear. Sweet old thing. Only two of those words describe Mom, so I know you're lying to me. We have unlimited juice? This party is going to be off the hook. Heyyyyyy, Uncle Father Oscar. Stop licking my hand, you horse's ass. Let the great experiment begin! Friday night. You must teach me the ways of the secular flesh. I was set up. By the Brits. A group of British builders operating outside the O.C. They want to break his legs. It's a good thing he's already got that little scooter. Tobias Fünke costume. And THAT'S why you always leave a note. I'll be in the hospital bar. You know there isn't a hospital bar, Mother. Well, this is why people hate hospitals.

If I wanted something your thumb touched I'd eat the inside of your ear. Oh…yeah…the guy in the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in three months. Come on! Here he comes. Here comes John Wayne. This objectification of women has to stop. It's just Mom and whores. He… she… what's the difference? Oh hear, hear. In the dark, it all looks the same. Either I zip down, or he zips up, and that is a mighty long zipper on Mother's Cher jumpsuit. Mission Accomplished. I need a tea to give my dingle less tingle.

They don't allow you to have bees in here. Fried cheese… with club sauce. Popcorn shrimp… with club sauce. Chicken fingers… with spicy club sauce. He's going to be all right. I'm sure Egg is a great person. The only thing I found in the fridge was a dead dove in a bag. The Man Inside Me seems well reviewed.

No, I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being WITH you. Happy Franklin Friday. Are all the guys in here… you know? George Sr: No not all of them. Barry: Yeah. It's never the ones you hope. Saw this on the highway and almost blue myself. Hop on? Stop it, stop it. This objectification of women has to stop. Michael: It's just Mom and whores. It's Sunday, but screw it — juice box time. Hey, it was one night of wild passion! And yet you didn't notice her body? I like to look in the mirror. You must teach me the ways of the secular flesh.

I guess you can say I'm buy-curious. Michael, you are not quite the ladies man I had pictured. Hopefully, we will remedy that when we are in the spa spreading body chocolate on each other. If you're suggesting I play favorites, you're wrong. I love all of my children equally. I don't care for Gob. See for more good stuff. I'll be in the hospital bar. You know there isn't a hospital bar, Mother. Well, this is why people hate hospitals.

Do the right thing here. String this blind girl along so that dad doesn't have to pay his debt to society. A flower in my garden, a mystery in my panties.
